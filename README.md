# dataviz
Data visualization system

Dataviz exports data from BigQuery, forecast time series, and visualize them in Grafana.

## Requirements
- Google Cloud service account JSON key file 
- Python 3.7
- Docker Compose

## Installation
1. Run `init.sh` file. It will create Python virtual environment and install Airflow.
`source init.sh`
2. Put JSON key file to `secrets` directory.
3. Run `docker-compose up`

## Using Dataviz
Open Airflow UI at `0.0.0.0:8080`. Ð¡onsequently run "extract", "training" and "inference" dags. 

"extract" imports data from BigQuery to local Postres database. "training" training trains AutoARIMA forecaster for "daily_confirmed_cases" time series. "inference" creates forecast for configured horizon.

Further, open Grafana at `0.0.0.0:3000`. It will visualize actual and forecasted data for "daily_confirmed_cases".

## Ways to improve performance
### Model
We could try different approaches to improve forecasting performance:
- Compartmental epidemiological models, e.g. SEIRD
- Fine-tuned ARIMA instead of AutoARIMA
- Facebook Prophet
- Stack different models to obtain better predictive performance

### Infrastucture
- Automate training set definition
- Use Apache Superset instead of Grafana
- Use model registry (e.g. MLFlow) instead of database for model storing
- Log model validation in experiment tracking system instead of Airflow logs
- Make more informative and prettier plots
